                     <h2>Who</h2>
                     <p>
                        At that time, our family consisted of me, my husband, our two kids, and our dog, Pandemonium Underfoot. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Panda (as we called her) was a very family-centered dog, but Panda made vacations stressful for all. When we took a vacation without her, she would pine and become dangerously ill. When we took a vacation with her, we knew we'd have an exasperating car journey with a panicking animal, who could not sleep or stop sneezing for the entire trip—every time she got out of the car it was with the hope that she'd arrived at our final destination. It could take a full day or longer for her to relax after the journey. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        That said, the best vacation was always going to be a full-family event, so we could spend time together.

                     <p>
                        Our vacation plans always included getting out into nature if we could. We love national parks. We're vegetarian, and like to do our own cooking on vacation. To have space for indoor fun if the weather was bad, we like to rent a cabin rather than camp. Most national parks don't allow dogs, so ideally we rent a place near good hiking just outside a national park. A place that would accept a 60 lb. dog both as a cabin guest and a trail companion.

                        The YMCA of the Rockies has very basic cabins with durable furniture that families with dogs can occupy—it's pretty difficult for humans or dogs to do much damage to anything.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        The YMCA property is adjacent to Rocky Mountain National Park, near the town of Estes Park, Colorado. The town is close enough to be a go-to for groceries and anything else that might make vacation more fun for kids, dogs, and adults.

                        We adopted Panda when she was about 18 months old from a local shelter, but we never knew when her actual birthday was. We celebrated her adoption day in April each year instead.

                        When we took her on our best vacation in the summer of 2010, she was about 10 years old.

                        Panda was our family's first dog. My husband and I had each had dogs growing up, but this was our first time being dog owners. Panda was a deeply sincere dog and a great companion to us, as well as a source of constant worry. She had many health issues. We were at the vet all the time. That spring we'd learned she had a new health problem: cancer.

                        If the best vacation is going hiking in the mountains with your dog, you need a good dog-friendly trail. My husband spent hours reading about area hikes and locating trailheads on maps, trying to determine how far we'd have to drive our car-panicked pup to get her to a lovely mountain hike she'd be thrilled to conquer. He tried to balance other factors for a successful dog hike, too: the elevation, the distance to the top, the difficulty of the terrain.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        The hiking was long, and we stopped to rest more frequently as we climbed higher. As we neared the mountain top, the trail gave out and it became a rock scramble with cairns marking the route. I unleashed Panda so I could use both hands and she nimbly picked her way alongside us. I re-leashed her at the crest, since there were drop-offs. To settle her, I found a rock where we could sit together, my arm around her shoulders. She put her nose into the wind and smiled.
